# Welcome to Ground Connection!

## What is Ground Connection?

Ground Connection is an app that is used specifically for any landscaping job you need done, but might not have the means to complete yourself! Maybe you don't have the right tools, maybe you have an injury, maybe you are on vacation, and simply can not do it yourself, or maybe you just don't WANT to do it yourself! 

In comes Ground Connection! All you need to do is set up your user account where you will add any skills you have (if you will be completing jobs for people) and all the basics like your name, email and a few others! Once you have your account set up, when you need a job completed, just post a job with a picture and details on what needs to be done, along with the address where the job will need to be completed and when you need it completed by. The more specific the details here the better, you want your applicants to know exactly what to do, with no ambiguity in what you want/need done!

When you post a job, other users will be able to see your job, and apply to it. You may get more than 1 applicant, and that's ok, that's what you want! When you get applicants, all you have to do is go into your posted job to view all the applications, look through them to find the applicant you want to complete the job and approve their application!

After approval, the approved person will come to the location listed in your Job posting, complete the job, take a/many picture(s) of the completed job and upload them to the Proof of Completion section for you to review!

## Why do you need this?

Why might you need this service? Do you enjoy mowing your grass when it is over 90 degrees, blazing sun, and 100% humidity?

No? Didn't think so, especially with that dang push mower!! Just log on and post a job for someone who has a *saaweeeeeeet* riding mower to come mow it for you!!


How about shoveling? Do you *reeeeally* enjoy shoveling that driveway, only to get halfway done and realize the first half is covered in snow already??

Yeah, me neither! Post a job for someone who has one of those **AWESOME** plows on their truck to come do it for you!!


Do you have a rental property, and maybe don't want to do the landscaping yourself or pay for a professional landscaping company, AND are a ***SUPER AMAZING*** Landlord, who doesn't make your tenants do that??

Post all the landscaping needs here! Not just limited to grass cutting and snow plowing!

Have a giant tree you need cut down? Post it!

Have a big garden with tons of weeds? Post it!

Have a big rock you want gone? Post it!

Need some firewood stacked? Post it!!

Maybe you know your grandma needs her lawn mowed, but you can't make it over there...Post it!.....but don't expect to get grandmas fresh baked chocolate chip cookies unless you do it yourself!!

Maybe you want a new pond in your yard....Sure, post that too!!

## Stretch Goals:

This app will have more features in the future! Here is a list of planned upgrades:

- Rating feature for all Users 
- Fully integrated transactions so everything can be done here in the app
- Ability to Filter Jobs to find ones suited specifically to your skill set and/or location
- Pricing tools to help aid in picking the right person for the job
- Notifications
- Time constraints on ratings and job completion confirmation 

## Technology Used

We used C# in this application as we are students currently learning and this is what we know.....well......at least sort of know! 

We first started with an idea like lawn mowing and landscaping. We quickly ran with it and created the Asana board first. Over the course of about 2 days, we had it in a good place, we started the DB Diagram. At first, as you can see in our Project Planning Document, this was a *hot mess express* but after ending the 2nd day and coming back on the 3rd day with fresh minds, we re-evaluated **both** the Asana board *and* the DB Diagram and came up with a much better, simpler DB Diagram, and more precice Asana board. After divying up all the work, we got started coding at the very end of the 3rd day and really starting on the 4th!

Below you can see the tools we used to help keep track of things:

### Asana
We used this to plan out our app with user stories, tasks and tickets, also to keep track of stretch goals, and to mark things done as they were getting done! We all agree that this is *much* more user friendly than Trello!

### Db Diagram
Db Diagram we used to help give us a visual representation of our tables and all the foreign keys needed

### Project Planning Document
Here is our Project Planning Document that has a good look at what we all contributed and what our tables and timeline looked like and also a snapshot of our Db Diagram *hot mess express* before... and *nice sleek, clean* after!
